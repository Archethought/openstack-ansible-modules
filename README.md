# Ansible modules for managing OpenStack

These are unofficial Ansible modules for managing OpenStack, which you may find useful until the official Ansible modules are implemented.

These will eventually be a dependency of the [openstack-ansible][1] repo for doing a test deployment of OpenStack into virtual machines managed by vagrant.
